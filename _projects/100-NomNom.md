### About:

A web app developed to allow people to crowdsource the names of applications. Developed using Python and the Flask framework, it was deployed on google app engine.

#### My Contribution:

My Contributions was primarily the moderation system. I was aware of how often systems such a these can and are abused, so I developed detailed moderation systems which used both user flagging as well as checking the entries for slurs and other insults. I then also developed an easy to use moderator back end, which can be used to remove or approve flagged objects.
