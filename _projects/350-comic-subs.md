### About:

A web app that I developed for personal use, to keep track of the comics I was reading and add the new chapters to an RSS feed, which I can the subscribe to. It screen scrapes pages from the comic's source, checking the latest issue to see if it is new, adding it to the feed if it is.

**All work in this project was done by me**
