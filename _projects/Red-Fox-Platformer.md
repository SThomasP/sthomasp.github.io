### About:

A Game developed as part of a university coursework with a theme of dynamics and tutorials. We developed the tutorial and first level of a platformer coding the animations and various kinds of jumps.

#### My Contribution:

My Contributions to this project was primarily integrating the code with the design parts. Getting the animations to work as well as making the tutorial prompts fade in and out when the player got too close to them. I also set up and configured the tilemap used for level design and coded in the scene transitions that are used for level progression.
