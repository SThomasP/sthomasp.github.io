### About:

This is a first year programming coursework, we had to develop a GUI application that allowed the user to explore the Mandelbrot fractal, as well as selecting points in it to explore the corresponding Julia fractal. The user can save points as well as exporting the current view as either an image or a reloadable file. They can also customize the colour scheme of the fractal.

**All work in this project was done by me**
