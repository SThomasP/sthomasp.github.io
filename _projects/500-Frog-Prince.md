### About:

A Game developed as part of a university coursework with a theme of narrative in games. We developed a game based on the story "The Frog Prince".

#### My Contribution:

My Contributions to this project was that I built the game controller, handling the transitions between the various game states and tracking the increase and decrease in stats.
