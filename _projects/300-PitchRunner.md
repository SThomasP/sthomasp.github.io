### About:

A Game developed as part of a university coursework with a theme of innovation in games. We developed a simple game where the aim was to move through mazes and collect items. We made it so that the character was controlled by whistling and the pitch of the whistling would change the direction the character was moving in.

#### My Contribution:

My Contributions to this project was the control scheme, using Unity's microphone input, analysing that to get the pitch of the note and then converting that into a direction. As well as this, I used a clock diagram to visualise the note being whistled.
