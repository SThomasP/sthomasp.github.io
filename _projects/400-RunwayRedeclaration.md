### About:

Second year software engineering group coursework, task was to develop an application that would be used to redeclare the available space on airport runways in the event of an obstacle on the runway. This project was developed with AGILE methods and regular deliverables were produced for the project supervisor.

#### My Contribution:

My primary contribution for this project was the visualisation on the left hand side of the application. I made it reflect the current state of the runway being used, detailing the obstacles, direction and available distances on the runway. I also made sure the program implemented an MVC structure, moving functions written by others around so they were in the correct place.
