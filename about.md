#### About Me

I am a software engineer who is currently studying in their final year at the University of Southampton. I have skills in a wide range of programming languages,  with confident skills in Python, Java, JavaScript, C# and bash.

My interests related to technology vary a lot, from web apps and browser extensions, to video games to the intersection between computers and languages.

On top of my coding skills I speak German confidently and I have excellent skills when it comes to technical writing.

I have strong morals and I am always looking to make tech a more diverse and inclusive place.

If any of this interests you, feel free to email me at: <steffanpadel@gmail.com>.
