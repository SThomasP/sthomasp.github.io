I’m currently searching for a post graduation job, which means cover letter and job advert after cover letter and job advert. On that topic, if you’ve got offices in Berlin and looking for a junior software developer to start at some point in the new year, check out [the about page](/about).

To make the job application process as painless as possible. I’ve started using trello, I'm subscribed to a few email alerts, RSS feeds and other methods of finding job adverts. What I then do is aggregate these job listing into a trello board. This board is sorted into six columns:

1. To Apply
2. Applying
3. Applied
4. Ghosted
5. Later Stages
6. Rejected (technically the archive section)

Once I find a job I think I’m suitable for, I’ll add a card for it to the “To Apply” column. Adding a link to the job advert and I where I found it in the description, this allows me easy access to a list of jobs that I can apply to, meaning I don’t have to search through multiple sites to try and find the listing again. From here, when I start writing the cover letter, I’ll move the job to the applying section.

When I start writing a cover letter, the first thing I’ll do is create a checklist on the card, this checklist will be a combination of stuff mentioned in the requirements section of the cover letter, as well as some things I think that I should highlight, my experiences with the products and domains of the company as well as technologies and programming languages they talk about in the advert. I then start writing the cover letter, and once I’ve covered a point in the checklist, I tick it off. With the checklist acting as an informal summary of the job and my suitable skills for it, I can write the cover letter much quicker than if I had to read through the advert several time to see if I’m covering all relevant points. So, I’ll write the cover letter, proofread it a couple of times and then get ready to send it off. This normally involves exporting the cover letter to a PDF and double a brief check on my CV.

With the cover letter and the checklist complete, I’ll fill out the application form and send it off to the company. The card for the job then gets moved to the “applied” column and I’ll set a date reminder on it for one month to the day. If I don’t hear back from the company by the due date on the card. I take this to mean the company isn’t interested, but hasn’t told me that yet. I’ll move the card to the “Ghosted” column. I don’t expect to hear back from these companies any more, and responses from them are generally not positive.

With the application done, the card will sit in “Applied” or “Ghosted” until I hear back from the company or the aforementioned one month period passes. If I hear back and the result is positive, I’ll move the card into the “Later Stages.” From here, the recruitment process is different for each company and there’s also a lot fewer jobs that get to this stage. So what I need to do is more company specific and easier to remember.

If I hear back from the company with a rejection, the card for that company gets archived and I forget about them, having already moved onto the next one. I used to have a column on the board for this, but the length of it was getting depressing, so I treat the archive as a “Rejected” column, keeping them out of sight, while still having them saved somewhere.

The next step is try and improve the process by which cards can get added, probably by linking up several apis in unique ways. This is going to be fun.
